# Performance workshops
We are competing for the fastest implementation of a particular problem. We will use google benchmark to gauge the speed of said implementation.

# The rules of engagement
Please provide a proper implementation and measure it against the baseline. Once you are satisfied with the performance of your code, you can submit it by zipping the "main.cpp" file and sending it to fastware.zukas@gmail.com.
Every week we will compete and discuss to find out what made a winning solution superior.
The week's winner has the honour of setting next week's challenge.
